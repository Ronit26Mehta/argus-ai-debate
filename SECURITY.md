## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of ARGUS seriously. If you have found a security vulnerability in ARGUS, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to **mehtaronit702@gmail.com**.

In your report, please include:

*   The version of ARGUS you are using.
*   A description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (proof of concept code is highly appreciated).
*   Potential impact of the vulnerability.

### Response Time

We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly. You can expect:

*   An acknowledgement of your report within **48 hours**.
*   Regular updates on our progress in addressing the issue.
*   A notification when the vulnerability is fixed.

### Disclosure Policy

We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the vulnerability before disclosing it publicly. We will coordinate with you on the public disclosure timeline.

### Bounty Program

Currently, we do not have a formal bug bounty program, but we greatly appreciate the contributions of security researchers who help us keep ARGUS safe. We are happy to publicly acknowledge researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities.

## Security Best Practices

When deploying ARGUS in production, especially when exposing it to the internet or untrusted users, please consider the following:

*   **API Keys**: Never commit API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) to version control. Use environment variables.
*   **Sandboxing**: If using the Python REPL tool or executing code generated by the LLM, ensure it runs in a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker container) to prevent unauthorized system access.
*   **Data Validation**: Always validate inputs to the debate engine to prevent injection attacks.

Thank you for helping keep the ARGUS ecosystem secure!
