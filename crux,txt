CRUX
Claim-Routed Uncertainty eXchange Protocol
Version 1.0 — Specification Draft
Designed for the ARGUS Multi-Agent Framework
2026

Abstract
CRUX (Claim-Routed Uncertainty eXchange) is a novel inter-agent communication protocol
designed specifically for debate-native, Bayesian multi-agent reasoning systems.

Unlike Google's A2A (task exchange) or Anthropic's MCP (tool invocation), CRUX is the
first protocol that treats epistemic state — beliefs, uncertainty distributions, argument
lineage, and credibility — as first-class citizens of inter-agent communication.

CRUX introduces seven primitive concepts: Epistemic Agent Cards, Claim Bundles,
Dialectical Routing, the Belief Reconciliation Protocol, the Credibility Ledger,
Epistemic Dead Reckoning, and the Challenger Auction. Together these enable ARGUS agents
to not just pass tasks, but to share, challenge, and converge on calibrated beliefs.
 
1. Motivation & Problem Statement
Modern multi-agent communication protocols address task delegation (A2A) and tool invocation (MCP). Neither was designed for the epistemic challenges inherent in debate-native reasoning systems like ARGUS.

1.1  The Missing Layer
When an ARGUS Specialist agent discovers high-confidence evidence and needs to share it with a Jury agent, it currently has no standard way to communicate:

•	What confidence distribution does this evidence carry?
•	What is the argument lineage — which prior claims does this build on?
•	Should the Jury weight this claim by the Specialist's historical calibration score?
•	Is this claim still open for challenge, or has a Refuter already engaged?

1.2  Comparison with Existing Protocols

Dimension	A2A (Google)	MCP (Anthropic)	CRUX (Novel)
Atomic Unit	Task	Tool Call	Claim Bundle
Carries Uncertainty	No	No	Yes — full Beta distribution
Agent Discovery	Agent Card (capability)	Server manifest	Epistemic Agent Card (domain + calibration)
Routing Logic	Capability match	Tool name match	Dialectical Fitness Score
Conflict Resolution	Not specified	Not applicable	Belief Reconciliation Protocol
Trust Model	OAuth / API key	OAuth / API key	Credibility Ledger (Bayesian)
Offline Resync	Not specified	Not applicable	Epistemic Dead Reckoning
Adversarial Design	No	No	Challenger Auction

 
2. Core Concepts
CRUX is built on seven primitives. Each maps directly onto an existing ARGUS component, making adoption incremental rather than a ground-up rebuild.

CRUX Primitive	ARGUS Mapping	What it replaces / extends
Epistemic Agent Card	AgentConfig + calibration metrics	A2A Agent Card (adds belief metadata)
Claim Bundle	C-DAG node (Evidence / Finding)	A2A Task (adds uncertainty payload)
Dialectical Routing	EDDO agent selection logic	A2A capability routing (adversarial-aware)
Belief Reconciliation Protocol	Jury + Bayesian aggregation	No prior art
Credibility Ledger	PROV-O hash-chain ledger	OAuth trust (statistical, not binary)
Epistemic Dead Reckoning	Provenance event replay	No prior art
Challenger Auction	Refuter assignment in EDDO	No prior art

 
3. Protocol Primitives
3.1  Primitive 1 — Epistemic Agent Card (EAC)
Every agent that participates in a CRUX network publishes an Epistemic Agent Card — a JSON document that extends A2A's Agent Card with belief-domain declarations and calibration metadata. Cards are served at a well-known endpoint and refreshed on each session.

{
  "crux_version": "1.0",
  "agent_id": "argus-specialist-oncology-001",
  "agent_type": "Specialist",
  "belief_domains": ["oncology", "clinical-trials", "RCT-methodology"],
  "calibration": {
    "brier_score": 0.112,
    "ece": 0.043,
    "credibility_rating": 0.91,
    "sample_size": 1847
  },
  "capabilities": {
    "emit_claims":    true,
    "challenge_claims": true,
    "render_verdicts": false,
    "max_rounds": 5
  },
  "crux_endpoint": "crux://argus.local/agents/specialist-oncology-001",
  "ledger_pubkey": "ed25519:AbCdEf..."
}

Key innovation: Calibration scores are not static claims — they are derived from the agent's history in the Credibility Ledger and updated after every debate session. An agent that has been consistently miscalibrated sees its effective credibility_rating decay, automatically reducing the Bayesian weight its future claims carry.

3.2  Primitive 2 — Claim Bundle (CB)
The Claim Bundle is the atomic unit of CRUX exchange. It is not a task, not a message, and not a tool call — it is a belief, fully specified with its uncertainty distribution and argument ancestry.

{
  "cb_id": "cb_sha256_7fa3b1c...",
  "schema": "crux/claim-bundle/1.0",
  "claim_text": "Treatment X reduces symptoms by more than 20%",
  "proposition_id": "prop_abc123",
  "polarity": 1,
  "prior": 0.50,
  "posterior": 0.73,
  "confidence_distribution": {
    "type": "beta",
    "alpha": 7.3,
    "beta": 2.7,
    "mean": 0.73,
    "std": 0.14
  },
  "evidence_refs": ["ev_001", "ev_002", "ev_003"],
  "argument_lineage_hash": "sha256:a1b2c3...",
  "issuer_agent": "argus-specialist-oncology-001",
  "issuer_credibility": 0.91,
  "challenge_open": true,
  "challenge_deadline_utc": "2026-03-01T12:00:00Z",
  "issued_at": "2026-02-20T09:00:00Z",
  "ttl_seconds": 3600,
  "signature": "ed25519:XyZ..."
}

The confidence_distribution field is the core innovation. Instead of a scalar confidence value (as in ARGUS's current Evidence node), CRUX carries a full parametric distribution — enabling proper Bayesian fusion when multiple agents emit contradicting Claim Bundles on the same proposition.

3.3  Primitive 3 — Dialectical Routing (DR)
Standard capability routing (A2A) picks any agent that can process a task. Dialectical Routing intentionally routes Claim Bundles toward agents best positioned to CHALLENGE them — maximising epistemic pressure and reducing echo-chamber failure modes.

Dialectical Fitness Score (DFS)
For each candidate agent a and incoming Claim Bundle cb, the orchestrator computes:

DFS(agent, cb) =
    w1 * domain_match(agent.belief_domains, cb.claim_text)
  + w2 * adversarial_potential(agent, cb.polarity)
  + w3 * agent.credibility_rating
  + w4 * (1 - recency_penalty(agent, cb.proposition_id))

# default weights: w1=0.35, w2=0.35, w3=0.20, w4=0.10

# adversarial_potential rewards agents whose prior on the
# proposition differs from the CB posterior — i.e., they are
# intrinsically motivated to push back.

Key constraint: An agent that issued the Claim Bundle is excluded from its own routing table — self-challenge is not permitted.

3.4  Primitive 4 — Belief Reconciliation Protocol (BRP)
When two agents issue contradicting Claim Bundles on the same proposition (opposite polarity or posterior divergence exceeding threshold θ), the CRUX orchestrator automatically triggers the Belief Reconciliation Protocol — a structured mini-debate that merges beliefs into a reconciled posterior.

BRP State Machine

IDLE
  │
  ▼  contradiction detected (|Δposterior| > θ AND polarity conflict)
TRIGGER
  │
  ▼  orchestrator spawns BRP sub-session
MINI_DEBATE  (1–3 rounds, configurable)
  │  each agent submits: challenge_claim, supporting_evidence_refs
  │  and updated confidence_distribution
  ▼
BAYESIAN_MERGE
  │  merged_posterior = Σ(credibility_i * posterior_i) / Σ(credibility_i)
  │  merged_distribution = moment-matched Beta from weighted mixture
  ▼
PROVENANCE_FORK
  │  lineage hash branches (like git merge commit)
  │  both original hashes preserved in ancestry chain
  ▼
RESOLVED  →  emit reconciled Claim Bundle

The reconciled Claim Bundle carries both original issuer_agent IDs in a contributors[] field, ensuring provenance is never lost during merges. This maps directly to ARGUS's PROV-O ledger and C-DAG edge semantics.

3.5  Primitive 5 — Credibility Ledger (CL)
The Credibility Ledger is a distributed, append-only log — compatible with ARGUS's existing SHA-256 hash chain — that records every agent's calibration history. It is the statistical trust layer of CRUX, replacing binary API-key authentication with probabilistic credibility scores.

Ledger Entry Schema

{
  "entry_id": "cl_sha256_...",
  "agent_id": "argus-specialist-oncology-001",
  "session_id": "session_xyz",
  "proposition_id": "prop_abc123",
  "predicted_posterior": 0.73,
  "ground_truth": 1,
  "brier_contribution": 0.073,
  "timestamp": "2026-02-20T10:00:00Z",
  "prev_entry_hash": "sha256:prev...",
  "entry_hash": "sha256:this..."
}

Credibility Update Rule

# Exponential moving average — recent performance weighted more
new_credibility = (1 - λ) * old_credibility + λ * (1 - brier_contribution)

# λ = recency weight, default 0.15
# brier_contribution in [0,1], lower = better

# Effect: an agent whose recent predictions are poor sees its
# credibility_rating fall, automatically down-weighting its
# Claim Bundles in future BRP merges.

3.6  Primitive 6 — Epistemic Dead Reckoning (EDR)
Agents in a long-running ARGUS session may disconnect mid-debate — network failure, restart, or provider timeout. Epistemic Dead Reckoning allows a reconnecting agent to reconstruct its belief state without replaying the full session, using only its last checkpoint hash and a compact delta bundle.

class EDRSync:
    """Called by an agent on reconnect."""

    def sync(self, agent_id: str, last_known_hash: str) -> EDRDelta:
        # 1. Locate checkpoint in PROV-O ledger
        checkpoint = ledger.find_entry(last_known_hash)

        # 2. Collect all Claim Bundles issued after checkpoint
        delta_cbs = ledger.get_bundles_after(checkpoint.timestamp)

        # 3. Detect conflicts with agent's last known beliefs
        conflicts = [cb for cb in delta_cbs
                     if conflicts_with(cb, agent.last_beliefs)]

        # 4. Trigger BRP for each conflict
        resolutions = [brp.resolve(c) for c in conflicts]

        return EDRDelta(bundles=delta_cbs, resolutions=resolutions)

EDR is designed to be idempotent — calling sync() multiple times with the same checkpoint hash returns the same delta, making it safe to retry after partial failures.

3.7  Primitive 7 — Challenger Auction (CA)
When a Claim Bundle is marked challenge_open: true, CRUX runs a Challenger Auction to select the best-positioned agent to rebut it. Unlike simple first-available assignment, the auction ensures the strongest possible adversarial engagement — a core requirement for ARGUS's epistemic integrity.

Auction Flow

1. CB is broadcast with challenge_open=true
2. Eligible agents (all except issuer) submit Challenger Bids:

   {
     "bidder_agent": "argus-refuter-002",
     "cb_id": "cb_sha256_7fa3b1c...",
     "estimated_dfs": 0.82,
     "domain_confidence": 0.88,
     "adversarial_strategy": "methodological_critique",
     "bid_expires": "2026-02-20T09:05:00Z"
   }

3. Orchestrator selects winner: argmax(estimated_dfs)
4. Winner is assigned; all other bids are rejected
5. If no bids within timeout → CB marked "unchallenged" (notable in provenance)

Why this matters: An unchallenged claim is weaker, epistemically, than a claim that survived adversarial scrutiny. CRUX marks the distinction explicitly in the Claim Bundle's provenance, allowing the Jury to apply a discount factor to posteriors that were never contested.

 
4. End-to-End Message Flow
The following shows a complete CRUX exchange for a standard ARGUS debate round, illustrating how all seven primitives interact.

ARGUS Session: "Does Treatment X reduce symptoms by >20%?"
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[1] DISCOVERY
    Moderator fetches Epistemic Agent Cards from all agents.
    Builds routing table with DFS scores per domain.

[2] SPECIALIST EMITS CLAIM BUNDLE
    Specialist-Oncology researches evidence →
    Emits CB{posterior=0.73, challenge_open=true}

[3] CHALLENGER AUCTION
    Refuter-001 bids DFS=0.79 (methodological_critique)
    Refuter-002 bids DFS=0.82 (counter_evidence)
    → Refuter-002 WINS auction

[4] REFUTER EMITS COUNTER-CLAIM BUNDLE
    Refuter-002 finds conflicting RCT data →
    Emits CB{posterior=0.41, polarity=-1, challenge_open=false}

[5] CONTRADICTION DETECTED → BRP TRIGGERED
    |Δposterior| = |0.73 - 0.41| = 0.32 > θ(0.20)
    polarity conflict: +1 vs -1
    → BRP sub-session spawned (2 rounds)

[6] BAYESIAN MERGE
    credibility(Specialist) = 0.91
    credibility(Refuter)    = 0.88
    merged_posterior = (0.91*0.73 + 0.88*0.41) / (0.91+0.88)
                     = 0.576

[7] RECONCILED CB → JURY
    Jury receives CB{posterior=0.576, contributors=[S,R]}
    Jury renders verdict: UNCERTAIN (prior 0.5 → posterior 0.576)

[8] CREDIBILITY LEDGER UPDATED
    Both agents' brier_contributions logged.
    EDR checkpoint hash recorded.

 
5. ARGUS Integration Guide
CRUX is designed to layer on top of ARGUS with minimal breaking changes. The integration path is additive: existing C-DAG, EDDO, and PROV-O components are extended rather than replaced.

5.1  What Changes

ARGUS Component	Change Required	Effort
Evidence (C-DAG node)	Add confidence_distribution field (Beta params)	Low
AgentConfig	Extend with belief_domains + calibration block → EAC	Low
EDDO orchestrator	Replace agent selection with DFS + Challenger Auction	Medium
ProvenanceLedger	Add Credibility Ledger schema + update rule	Medium
RDCOrchestrator	Add BRP trigger logic + EDR sync on reconnect	Medium
Jury agent	Accept reconciled CB from BRP rather than raw C-DAG	Low

5.2  New CRUX Endpoint
ARGUS agents expose a new /crux endpoint alongside existing APIs:

GET  /crux/card           → Epistemic Agent Card
POST /crux/claim          → Submit a Claim Bundle
POST /crux/bid            → Submit a Challenger Bid
GET  /crux/ledger/{agent} → Credibility Ledger for agent
POST /crux/sync           → EDR resync request
WS   /crux/stream         → Real-time CB subscription (SSE compatible)

5.3  Python Sketch

from argus.crux import ClaimBundle, CRUXOrchestrator, CredibilityLedger

# Existing ARGUS setup
orchestrator = RDCOrchestrator(llm=llm, max_rounds=5)

# Wrap with CRUX layer
crux = CRUXOrchestrator(
    base=orchestrator,
    ledger=CredibilityLedger(backend="prov-o"),
    contradiction_threshold=0.20,
    auction_timeout_seconds=30,
)

# Run a CRUX-enabled debate
result = crux.debate(
    "Treatment X reduces symptoms by more than 20%",
    prior=0.5,
)

print(result.verdict.label)          # UNCERTAIN
print(result.reconciled_cb.posterior) # 0.576
print(result.challenger_auction.winner) # refuter-002

 
6. Security & Trust Model
6.1  Signature Verification
Every Claim Bundle must be signed with the issuing agent's Ed25519 private key (declared in its EAC). Recipients verify the signature before accepting the CB into the C-DAG. Unsigned bundles are rejected.

6.2  Sybil Resistance
The Credibility Ledger provides natural Sybil resistance: a new agent starts with a neutral credibility_rating of 0.50 and must build a track record before its Claim Bundles carry significant weight in BRP merges. A cluster of new agents with identical belief_domains triggers an anomaly alert.

6.3  Replay Attack Prevention
Each Claim Bundle carries a nonce and a TTL. Bundles received after their ttl_seconds window are rejected. The PROV-O ledger's hash chain makes replay of old bundles detectable — the hash will not chain correctly into the current ledger head.

6.4  Adversarial Agent Detection
An agent whose credibility_rating drops below a configurable floor (default 0.30) is automatically suspended from the Challenger Auction and its Claim Bundles are flagged for human review. This prevents a persistently miscalibrated or malicious agent from influencing verdicts.
